# First Bootcamp Assignment

In this assignment, I will provide the user with a clean and sematic styled HTML content which follows accessibility standards so that the website is optimized for the search engines.

## Things I've worked on

When I view the source code.

-Then I find semantic HTML elements.

When I view the structure of the HTML elements.

-Then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

When I view the image elements.

-Then I find accessible alt attributes.

When I view the heading attributes.

-Then they fall in sequential order.

When I view the title element.

-Then I find a concise, descriptive title.

When I find multiple class using the same properties.

-Then I merge them in a single code if possible.

When I make changes in the CSS file.

-Then I make a comment above the code.
